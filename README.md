# MavenModuleBuilder
Maven Module Builder is an app designed to help building huge multi-module web projects. It is designed to build modules and/or submodules and to replace JAR files in target folders immediately after build to help developers skip the task of copying the JAR file every after build.

Instead of building the whole project after fixing one part of the project, this module can help build single modules, and it is a lot faster. This also can provide to be useful to people who know least about building in Maven. This documentation assumes you have at least an idea of what Maven is and how to program in Java.
